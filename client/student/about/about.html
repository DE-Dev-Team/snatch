   <h1>About Us</h1>

    <br>
    <br>
   
    
    <p>Denison Enterprises was founded in 2014 when students recognized there were no outlets for hands-on business experience on campus. Currently, the group is working with the Bandersnatch, helping to transition the late-night snack spot to run like a true business.

    <br>
    This application was created by the Denison Enterprises Sofware Development Team with the goals of digitizing the ordering process, implementing a record keeping system, allowing management to make statistically informed business decisions, reducing wait times, and ultimately bettering the Bandersnatch experience!</p>
